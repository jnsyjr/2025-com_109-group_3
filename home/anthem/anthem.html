          <em>"You'll Never Walk Alone"</em> is more than just a song ‚Äî it's a
          symbol of unity, strength, and unwavering support among Liverpool FC
          fans. Originally from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical
          <strong>Carousel</strong> (1945), the song was famously covered by
          Gerry and the Pacemakers in 1963. It quickly became the club's anthem,
          sung passionately by fans before every match at Anfield.

        <p>
          Over the decades, the anthem has come to represent the heart of the
          club‚Äôs culture. Its lyrics remind players and fans alike that they are
          never alone in their passion and loyalty.
